                    Hi, I’m John Nelson-Alden. I am a lifelong Chicagoan and I love this city. Chicagoans are a proud and diverse 
                    bunch and we don’t always agree amongst ourselves… However, there is one thing we DO all agree on: Chicago 
                    politics is and always has been corrupt! We often feel our representatives do not represent the citizens of the 
                    city. We are presented half truths and fabrications as fact and simplistic political agendas are promoted as 
                    solutions to complex societal problems. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I created Shy Jack to bring important data directly to the great people of the City of Chicago, free of any 
                    political or ideological spin. The raw, unmanipulated data can be mapped and graphed according to the users 
                    search parameters, providing them access to easily understandable visual representations of the data that 
                    matters to them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Chicago is a great city, but that greatness has been earned and is a status that must be dutifully maintained. 
                    Maintaining greatness requires internal reflection and identifying all weaknesses and problems and making 
                    conscious efforts to improve them. Like any city, Chicago has its share of problems that must be addressed. 
                    The numbers are clear that carjacking is one issue that is on track to be the worst in decades. Now that we have 
                    identified this, we must attempt to fully understand the trends by analyzing the shape of the data.

                    There are a lot of different stories about what is going on with crime in my city, coming from a lot of different 
                    camps with different political agendas. Shy Jack is here to tell the true story, the story of the numbers. Numbers 
                    don’t lie, politicians do. This is a tool to focus attention on the often overlooked macrotrends in the data. 
                    Shy Jack is not here to propose solutions or take any political stance on these issues. Shy Jack is simply a broker 
                    of honest information. Please do not mistake this honesty for negativity. It is meant to assist Chicago in the 
                    process of perpetual improvement that has transformed the swampy shores of Lake Michigan into one of the finest 
                    cities on the planet.
